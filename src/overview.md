# Overview

Linera is a blockchain infrastructure project that aims to provide a web3 infrastructure with predictable performance and responsiveness at scale. The project includes several innovations, including an integrated multi-chain system with elastic validators, making multi-chain programming mainstream, and robust decentralization for elastic validators.

The Linera multi-chain protocol is designed to take advantage of modern cloud infrastructures and supports an unlimited number of microchains. In Linera, a validator is an elastic web2-like service that validates and executes blocks of transactions in many chains in parallel. Every Linera user is encouraged to create a chain that they own and place their accounts there. Microchains interact using asynchronous messages and run independently. Microchains may differ in the way they accept new blocks, and validators can scale elastically by dividing their workload between many internal workers (aka. shards).

Linera integrates many chains in a unique set of validators, which greatly facilitates cross-chain communication. The execution model of Linera is designed to be language-agnostic and developer-friendly, and Linera applications are composable and multi-chain. Linera also relies on delegated proof of stake (DPoS) for security and supports regularly changing sets of validators. Microchains are designed to be auditable independently, allowing for distributed audits by the community.

Overall, the Linera project aims to provide a more efficient and scalable infrastructure for blockchain applications while maintaining decentralization and security.
